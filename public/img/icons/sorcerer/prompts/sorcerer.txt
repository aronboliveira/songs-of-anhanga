A highly detailed logo inspired by the World of Warcraft logo style. The logo should feature a medallion symbol representing a Sorcerer with control over elemental magic, shadows, and light. It should incorporate dark lilac and violet as primary colors, with cyan and teal as secondary colors, and details in gold. The design should be intricate, featuring elements of RPG fantasy such as runes, sigils, and summoning symbols. The logo should have depth and shading to enhance its mystical and powerful appearance.
