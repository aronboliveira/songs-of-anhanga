A highly detailed and serious logo in the form of a semi-realistic fantasy medallion symbol representing Engineers and Tinkers with control over high level technology. The medallion should feature elements of RPG fantasy such as dieselpunk engines, propellers, flow of data, and contraptions. The design should have depth and shading, with dark brown and dark grey as primary colors, and details in gold and dark blue. The logo should convey a mystical and powerful appearance.
