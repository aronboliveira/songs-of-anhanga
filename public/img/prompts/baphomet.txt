A monster inspired by Ragnarok Online card drawings, resembling the Baphomet creature from the game. This creature has a large, imposing figure with goat-like features, including horns and a menacing gaze. Its body is muscular and covered in dark fur, and it wields a large, intimidating staff or weapon. The style is reminiscent of the detailed, colorful illustrations of Ragnarok Online cards, with a fantasy theme and a slightly cartoonish, yet serious and menacing appearance. The background should reflect a mystical or ominous setting, enhancing the creature's powerful and dark presence.
