Adjust the image of the Pasana-inspired monster to hold its scimitar in a more natural, menacing way, and replace any out-of-place elements like feathers with a sand-colored nemes headdress, typical of ancient Egyptian royalty. This headdress should fit the monster's skeletal, armored form, enhancing its desert power theme. The scimitar should be held firmly, ready for battle, with its engraved Egyptian symbols prominently displayed. The background should remain a desert or ancient ruins, with swirling sand, maintaining the aggressive and dynamic posture of the creature.
