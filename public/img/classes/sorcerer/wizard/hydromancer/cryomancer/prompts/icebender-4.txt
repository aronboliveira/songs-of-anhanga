An elderly wizard halfling with control over magic ice, styled like a League of Legends splash art, depicted on a large dieselpunk rooftop covered in ice, with a magic fog in the colors of blue to violet. The frame is angled diagonally and lowered from the character height, with relative distance. They are posing dynamically with elegance and confidence. The character has peach-colored skin, spiky grey hair, and a long, thick beard with upturned mustache points. They wear an archmage gown floating with heavy winds, leaving burning splashes of ice around them. They have many runic accessories, indicating their power and hierarchy. Their hands are gesturing in a calling movement, guiding their magic ice to flow upwards. Their eyes are droopy, downturned, and wide, with arched eyebrows emanating a dark blue fog. They are summoning magic using pale blue sigils that brim around in magic floating, translucent medallions. Their nose is large and Roman-shaped, with very thick eyebrows.
