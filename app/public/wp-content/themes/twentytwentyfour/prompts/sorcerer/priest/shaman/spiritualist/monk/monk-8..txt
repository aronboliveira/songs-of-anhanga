A shaman inspired by a style similar to League of Legends splasharts. The background features a grove under daylight in the Atlantic Forest. The frame shows the character from an angled, dynamic point of view, enacting concentration and spirituality. The character is a mystic and spiritualistic human man with thin lips, a large downturned neat nose, a rectangular face, and light black skin. He looks approximately 30 years old. He emanates a spiritual fog ranging from pale yellow to pale red across his body, mainly through his eyes and shoulders. He has upturned and large eyes with lowered eyebrows, as if energetically pushing his inner strength. His body is muscular and slender. He is a spiritual guide inspired by the Candomblé culture, evoking bursting lava, strong winds, and thunder in the background. There are silhouettes of elemental spirits in the shapes of flames and hurricanes with bright upturned dark yellow eyes in the background, meddling in the corresponding element. The main character is in a ritualistic pose, stretching his arms skywards like in a ritual of summoning furious spirits. He is bald, wears subtle makeup slightly brighter than his skin, and has a lot of ritualistic yellow, orange, and red paintings covering his body with symbols resembling tribal and African religious rituals, with drawings representing Orixá and Christian entities. He has many ritualistic clips, bands, necklaces, and piercings made of wood, stone, and horns, similar to those of African-descendant religions. He wears a turban and a simple dress with stripes of yellow and red.
