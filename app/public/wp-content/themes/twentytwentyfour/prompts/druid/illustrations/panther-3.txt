A dynamic and intense image of a shaman inspired by League of Legends splasharts, with inspirations from Udyr. The background is a shady Amazonic Forest during the day. The shaman is shown from an angled, dynamic point of view, enacting agility and ferocity in a ritualistic and feral stance, deeply entranced and threatening the viewer with hands wrapped by spiritual, foggy aura forming the shape of a tiger paw with long claws. Spiritual waves in pale yellow to pale red colors surround the shaman, forming foggy silhouettes of animals beside him. The character is a mystic and spiritualistic half-elf man with heavy lips, a neat nose, rectangular face, squared chin, and pale brown skin, looking approximately 30 years old. He wears rustic tribal clothes, partially ripped from an animal attack, looking battle-hardened and aggressive. He has many wood-carved and stone-carved piercings and enlargers, upturned and thin eyes, and upturned eyebrows expressing a special magical flow. His body is extremely muscular and hardened, with many claw and fang-shaped scars. His long, extremely disheveled and wavy hair complements his ritualistic yellow, orange, and red body paintings with symbols resembling tribal rituals and animal drawings.
