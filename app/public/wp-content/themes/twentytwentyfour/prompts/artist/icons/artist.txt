A highly detailed and serious logo in the form of a semi-realistic fantasy medallion symbol that represents Artists with control over magical music. The logo should have depth and shading, and incorporate dark orange and gold as primary colors, with details in lilac and dark green. It should feature elements of RPG fantasy such as runes, enchanted instruments, magic music notes, sound waves, and splashed paint to enhance its mystical and powerful appearance.
