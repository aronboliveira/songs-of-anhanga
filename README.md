---- SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC GOALS

Our web project aims to introduce the conceptual arts and lore for an interactive, co-op, turn-based combat RPG that can be played through online sessions (both desktop and mobile), and in couch gaming.

The project has a deep cultural root on the Brazilian folklore, religious culture, biodiversity and artistic manifestations, having as ony of our primary goals to fulfill these niches.

We strive to make our characters as inclusive as possible, representing a wide varieties of physical variations of characters and regional cultures.

---- IMAGES AND REFERENCES

This is a project heavily inspired by D&D (owned by Wizards of the Coast LLC) style games, MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft (Owned by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.) and Ragnar√∂k Online (owned by Gravity Interactive LLC), and MOBAs such as DOTA 2 (owned by Valve Corporation) and League of Legends (owned by Riot Games, Inc.).

All our current illustrations are produced by the use of Dall-E (an generative AI model owned by OpenAI) using references to the previous mentioned games, therefore we only claim authorship over the prompts for generating the images, not the images themselves.
